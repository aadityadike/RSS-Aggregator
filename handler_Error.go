/*
Explanation:

    The code begins with a package main, indicating that this Go file is part of the main package, which is the entry point for a Go application.
    The import "net/http" statement imports the "net/http" package, which provides functions and structures to build HTTP servers and clients in Go.
    The handlerError function is defined to handle errors in the HTTP server. The function takes two parameters: w http.ResponseWriter, which is used to write the HTTP response, and r *http.Request, which represents the incoming HTTP request.
    The function respondWithError is not shown in the snippet but is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase. It is used to encapsulate the logic for sending an HTTP response with an error status code and a custom error message to the client.
    The comment above the handlerError function clarifies its purpose, stating that it's responsible for handling errors and sending a custom error message back to the client.
    The comment inside the function provides additional information about how the respondWithError function is utilized, specifically, to send an error response with a status code of 400 (Bad Request) and a descriptive error message.

Overall, the snippet is a part of a larger HTTP server application in Go, and the handlerError function ensures that when errors occur during the handling of incoming requests, the client receives a clear and user-friendly error message with the appropriate HTTP status code.
