# RSS Aggregator

**Aggregator:** A program that collects related items of content and displays them or links to them.
An RSS aggregator, also known as an RSS reader, is a software application or web service that collects and organizes content from various websites or blogs that publish content in RSS (Really Simple Syndication) format. RSS is a standardized XML-based format used for content syndication, allowing websites to distribute their updates in a structured way.

The primary purpose of an RSS aggregator is to provide users with a centralized location where they can access and read the latest content from multiple sources without having to visit each website individually. By subscribing to RSS feeds of their favorite websites, users can receive automatic updates whenever new content is published.

RSS aggregators can be web-based or desktop applications, and they typically allow users to organize their subscriptions into categories or folders. The aggregator fetches the latest updates from the subscribed websites, presents them in a unified format, and often provides options for users to mark items as read, share them on social media, or save them for later.

Using an RSS aggregator can be particularly beneficial for individuals who follow a large number of websites, blogs, or news sources. It helps streamline the process of staying up-to-date with the latest content, as users can quickly scan headlines and summaries to determine which articles they want to read in more detail.

While RSS was once a widely used technology, social media platforms and other content distribution methods have somewhat reduced its popularity. However, RSS aggregators continue to be valued tools for people who prefer a more focused and customizable approach to consuming online content
