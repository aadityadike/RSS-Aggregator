# RSS Aggregator

**Aggregator:** A program that collects related items of content and displays them or links to them.
An RSS aggregator, also known as an RSS reader, is a software application or web service that collects and organizes content from various websites or blogs that publish content in RSS (Really Simple Syndication) format. RSS is a standardized XML-based format used for content syndication, allowing websites to distribute their updates in a structured way.

The primary purpose of an RSS aggregator is to provide users with a centralized location where they can access and read the latest content from multiple sources without having to visit each website individually. By subscribing to RSS feeds of their favorite websites, users can receive automatic updates whenever new content is published.

RSS aggregators can be web-based or desktop applications, and they typically allow users to organize their subscriptions into categories or folders. The aggregator fetches the latest updates from the subscribed websites, presents them in a unified format, and often provides options for users to mark items as read, share them on social media, or save them for later.

Using an RSS aggregator can be particularly beneficial for individuals who follow a large number of websites, blogs, or news sources. It helps streamline the process of staying up-to-date with the latest content, as users can quickly scan headlines and summaries to determine which articles they want to read in more detail.

While RSS was once a widely used technology, social media platforms and other content distribution methods have somewhat reduced its popularity. However, RSS aggregators continue to be valued tools for people who prefer a more focused and customizable approach to consuming online content.

## Explanation:

1. The code imports necessary packages required to run an HTTP server and set up routing and middleware.

2. `godotenv.Load()` is used to load environment variables from a .env file (if it exists in the project directory). This allows you to set environment-specific configuration for the server without hardcoding values in the code.

3. `portString := os.Getenv("PORT")` retrieves the port number from the environment variables. The server will listen on this port.

4. `log.Fatal("PORT is not found in environment")` checks if the PORT environment variable is defined. If not, the server cannot start, and it logs a fatal error, causing the program to exit.

5. `chi.NewRouter()` creates a new router instance using the "chi" router library. This router will handle incoming HTTP requests.

6. The section under `router.Use(cors.Handler(cors.Options{...}))` sets up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration. CORS is essential for allowing web clients from different origins to access resources on the server. This configuration allows any HTTP or HTTPS origin to send requests and specifies the allowed HTTP methods, headers, exposed headers, and other CORS settings.

7. `chi.NewRouter()` creates a new sub-router called `v1Router` for version 1 of the API.

8. `v1Router.Get("/healthz", handlerReadiness)` associates the "/v1/healthz" URL path with the `handlerReadiness` function. This function will be executed when a GET request is made to "/v1/healthz".

9. `v1Router.Get("/err", handlerError)` associates the "/v1/err" URL path with the `handlerError` function. This function will be executed when a GET request is made to "/v1/err".

10. `router.Mount("/v1", v1Router)` mounts the `v1Router` under the "/v1" prefix in the main router. This ensures that all requests starting with "/v1" will be handled by the sub-router `v1Router`.

11. An HTTP server instance `srv` is created with the `router` as the handler and the specified port to listen on.

12. A log message is printed indicating that the server is starting on the specified port.

13. `srv.ListenAndServe()` starts listening and serving HTTP requests. The server will run indefinitely, handling incoming requests.

14. In case of an error during server startup (e.g., if the specified port is already in use), the `err` variable will be non-nil, and the program will log a fatal error and exit. Otherwise, the server will continue running indefinitely.

Overall, this code sets up a basic HTTP server with routing and CORS configuration, allowing it to handle specific API endpoints and respond to health check requests ("/v1/healthz") and error requests ("/v1/err").
